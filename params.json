Author provided a description of the theory and code of the product here [Wiki Optimel](https://github.com/popova-ob-77/Optimel.wiki.git).\r\n## The purpose of the research\r\n**The purpose of the research** - automate the process of choice of optimization method for the significantly reduce time. In software were used new methods - data structuring (binary tree of question-answer system), submission of decision trees (approximated to the natural intelligence). Can be used in production for solving applied problems, in research institutes and in schools for educational purposes. Effectively in conducting literary-patent review, because saves time and money; determines the level of scientific research; expands the number of alternatives from which choice is made; increases the user's skill level; expands outlook and reveals new research objectives.\r\n\r\n### Release of the software Optimel \r\nWe used for building Optimel software product the freely available Lazarus 1.6.0 - free cross-platform IDE, using a free compiler Free Pascal.
